# Laravel Components

A collection of my own reusable Blade and Livewire components. They may be of some limited use to you, but the most value you're likely to derived from this package is to use it as an example of how to build your own reusable component library.

## Installation
```shell script
composer require grosv/blade-components
```


## Available Components

```blade
<x-button color="(optional)Tailwind Color"><img src="icon or whatever" alt=""> Button Text</x-button>
```
